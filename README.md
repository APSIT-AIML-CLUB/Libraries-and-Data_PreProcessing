# Machine Learning Libraries and Data Preprocessing Workshop

Welcome to the AIML Club workshop! In this session, we’ll explore essential Python libraries for data science and machine learning using Google Colab. This README provides an overview of the libraries we’ll be working with:

- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-Learn**

## Libraries Overview

### 1. Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures like Series and DataFrame, which are ideal for handling and analyzing structured data.

**Key Features:**
- DataFrame and Series objects
- Data manipulation (filtering, grouping, merging)
- Handling of missing data

**Installation in Google Colab:**
```python
!pip install pandas
```

### 2. Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a variety of plotting styles and customizations.

**Key Features:**
- Line plots, scatter plots, histograms
- Customizable plot appearance
- Integration with Pandas and NumPy

**Installation in Google Colab:**
```python
!pip install matplotlib
```

### 3. Seaborn
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

**Key Features:**
- Built-in themes and color palettes
- Easy creation of complex visualizations (heatmaps, violin plots)
- Integration with Pandas DataFrames

**Installation in Google Colab:**
```python
!pip install seaborn
```

### 4. NumPy
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

**Key Features:**
- N-dimensional array objects
- Mathematical functions and operations
- Linear algebra routines

**Installation in Google Colab:**
```python
!pip install numpy
```

### 5. Scikit-Learn
Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It features various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

**Key Features:**
- Preprocessing utilities
- Classification, regression, and clustering algorithms
- Model evaluation and selection

**Installation in Google Colab:**
```python
!pip install scikit-learn
```
